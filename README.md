<div align="center"> Welcome! ðŸ’› <img src="http://raw.githubusercontent.com/aemmadi/aemmadi/master/wave.gif" width="30px"><br>
  I'm Yoddit, an aspiring full stack developer who's teaching myself to code and build websites. I'm transitioning from a healthcare background and my proclivity to all things TECH make this the perfect career for me. I'm currently based in Houston TX, but I'm a New Yorker, born and raised (GO KNICKS!!!!!) I have a passion for helping people and solving complex problems, and when I'm not coding or taking care of my 3 boys, you can find me learning something new or watching a new show (recently I've learned how to be a Salesforce administrator after spending thousands of hours on projects --- currently I'm obsessed with <i>Mayor of Kingstown</i>! Renner is soooo good.)<br></div>
